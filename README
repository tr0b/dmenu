dmenu - dynamic menu - tr0b edition
====================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X. This version has been modified to fit my personal preferences.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install

Additional Setup
-------------
Be sure to copy config.def.h to config.h file.
If something doesn't work after patching, you can reset back to a previous commit :) .
